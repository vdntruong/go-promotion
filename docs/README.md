# Promotion System Missing Techniques and Reminders

This README provides additional information about missing techniques and reminders for the promotion system.

## Missing Techniques

### Logging

Implement logging in each service to track system activities, errors, and performance metrics. Use a logging framework such as Logrus or Zap to capture and analyze logs effectively.

### Monitoring

Set up monitoring for the promotion system to track service health, resource utilization, and user activity. Use monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana to collect metrics and visualize system performance.

### Load Balancer

Deploy a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances of each service. Use load balancing techniques such as round-robin or least connections to optimize resource utilization and improve system reliability.

### SSL Deployment Option

Enable SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication between clients and the promotion system. Use tools like Let's Encrypt to obtain and configure SSL certificates, and deploy them with your load balancer or reverse proxy.

### Authentication for Internal Services

Implement authentication mechanisms to secure access to internal services within the promotion system. Use authentication protocols like OAuth2 or JWT to authenticate and authorize users, and enforce access control policies to protect sensitive resources.

## Reminders

- Ensure that Docker is properly configured on your host machine to support networking and container communication.
- Check the version of Go installed on your system and ensure that it meets the minimum requirements for the promotion system.
- Review the README file of the promotion system for installation and setup instructions, as well as additional details about its components and usage.
